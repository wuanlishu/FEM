# FEM coding from zero

## LAYOUT

The basic process is:
0. Read input .nas/.bdf file: 
1. Parse it as mesh format and check its validity;
2. Get material properity;
3. Calculate element stiffness matrix and assembly them as global stiffness matrix;
4. Based boundary condition to calculate stress and strain;
5. Output stress and strain to file.

## POSTSCRIPT
it is a project for me, Q.Zhou, to learn about how to code fem with C++, and ~~later Fortran edition will upload~~.

One more thing, it's interesting for me after I leaving out of school.

Studying is fun. For a long time, I have not felt like this.

Oh, do not try to compile it now, I have not completed it. it needs some time for me.

One more thing, Language Grammar is annoying.
